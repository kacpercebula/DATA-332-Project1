# Project1 - Sentiment Analysis

## Description  

In this project, I was given a dataset of consumer complaints from various different companies, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and Equifax for example. The data set included the issue, date recevied, company, product, etc. I wrote an R script program that cleans and analyzes the data using sentiment analysis. I chose specific companies to focus on, a specific word (anger) to use, and also some comaprisons between companies to understand more about the consumer complaints dataset. I am hosting a shiny app that is comparing the specifc words and their sentiment contribution dynamically by allowing the user to choose which comapnies to anlayze, the link is provided right here ->
